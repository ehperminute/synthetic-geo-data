# Synthetic Geographic Data Generator & Mapping

This project creates a synthetic geographic dataset (population, services, and infrastructure distribution), visualizes it on a simple map, and demonstrates a reproducible data workflow using Python.

The goal is to show how synthetic data can be generated, cleaned, analyzed, and visualized without relying on external real-world datasets. This makes the project portable, safe to share, and easy to extend.
